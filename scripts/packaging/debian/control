Description: webbased groupware and crm - metapackage
 Tine 2.0 is an open source project which combines groupware and CRM in one
 consistent interface. Tine 2.0 is web-based and optimises collaboration and
 organisation of groups in a lasting manner. Tine 2.0 unites all the
 advantages of open source software with an extraordinarily high level of
 usability and an equally high standard of professional software development.
 This is what makes the difference between Tine 2.0 and many other existing
 groupware solutions.
 Tine 2.0 includes address book, calendar, email, tasks, time tracking and
 CRM. Intelligent functions and links make collaboration in Tine 2.0 a true
 pleasure and include:
  * Synchronising mobile telephones
  * VoiP integration
  * Flexible assigning of authorisation rights
  * Dynamic lists
  * Search functions
  * History
  * PDF export
