1. New Queue management
-----------------
- Cli method Tinebase.processQueue got deleted. The Queue worker must not 
  longer be a cronjob.
- A queue worker daemon got added see Tinebase/Redis/Worker/Daemon.php
- The new daemon only supports Redis as queue backend atm.
- The Rediska library is not longer supported
- PhpRedis is now required for the Redis adapter
- configuration in config.inc.php:
    'actionqueue' => array(
      'adapter'       => 'Redis',
      'driverOptions' => array(
        'host'  => 'HOSTNAME',
      ),
    ),

2. Calendar Default Sync Filter
-----------------
The default calendar sync filter is now:
Event is in one of my personal calendars AND I'm attendee AND I have not declined.
This way you don't see recurring exceptions you don't attend any longer and
duplicate events originating in other users personal calendars are suppressed

3. Calendar Edit Views
-----------------
When editing an event, the user can now choose which perspective he want's to
edit via the "view" combo box. The view can be "organiser" or one of the 
attendee. In organiser view, the event details and the default alarms and 
transparency can be set. In attendee view alarms and transparency for the
particular attendee can be set. This attendee details overwrite the organiser
defaults for the attendee

4. Calendar Alarms
-----------------
Multiple event alarms could be configured by the organiser. Each attendee can
add further alarms and remove organiser alarms for herself.
In the calendar preference each user can now define if he wan't default alarms
and how many minutes before this default alarms should occur. Default alarms
are appended to new events the user create via the Tine 2.0 Client.

5. Calendar colours and tags
-----------------
The event colour in the sheet views is now determined by the colour of the
originating calendar if the user has access to this calendar. A mouse over on
the calendar in the details panel now shows both calendars, the originating and
the display calendar. Tags are now presented in the events for the sheet views.

6. Calendar organiser change
-----------------
The organiser can now be changed for existing events.

7. Password policies
-----------------
New password policies can be configured in the setup "Authentication and Accounts" panel.
You can define minimal length, number of special chars/numbers/uppercase chars and so on.

8. PostgreSQL support
-----------------
The PostgreSQL database is now fully supported and can be selected in the setup.

9. Felamimail vacation templates
-----------------
The sieve vacation message configuration now supports templates for easier setup of 
default vacation messages for all users. To activate the usage of templates, all you need
to do is to put a template file into the following webdav directory:

 /webdav/Felamimail/shared/Vacation Templates

An example template file might look like this:

    Ich bin vom {startDate-de_DE} bis zum {endDate-de_DE} im Urlaub. Bitte kontaktieren Sie
     {representation-n_fn-1} ({representation-email-1}) oder {representation-n_fn-2} ({representation-email-2}).
    
    I am on vacation until {endDate-en_US}. Please contact {representation-n_fn-1}
    ({representation-email-1}) or {representation-n_fn-2} ({representation-email-2}) instead.
    
    {owncontact-n_fn}

10. Felamimail body caching
-----------------
It is now possible to deactivate the caching of email bodies. This can be useful for fast IMAP
servers and is done by switching the value of the Felamimail config "cacheEmailBody" to "0".
This can be done by calling the following CLI command:

 php setup.php --setconfig -- configkey=cacheEmailBody configvalue=0 app=Felamimail

11. PHP 5.3 required
--------------------
Tine 2.0 now requires a minimal PHP version of 5.3.0.

12. Example .htaccess
--------------------

We added an example .htaccess file for Apache 2 webservers. You can activate it by moving the file 
docs/htaccess to the Tine 2.0 root and renaming it to .htaccess.
